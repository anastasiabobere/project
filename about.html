          In the past 20 years, clothing production has approximately doubled
          due to higher demand from a growing middle class around the world.
          Meanwhile, garment usage lifetime has decreased on the consumer side.
          This embodies the “fast fashion” phenomenon: more options, quicker
          trend turnaround, lower prices, and unpriced damage to the
          environment.
          <br />Most shocking in the graph is the decrease in clothing
          utilisation: 36% globally. China saw a whopping 70% decrease over the
          same time period, and 60% of German and Chinese citizens admit to
          owning more clothes than they need. The picture varies from location
          to location, with Europeans usually spending more on fewer items each
          year, while Americans or Chinese buy far more pieces per person.

        <h3>Why is it so important ?</h3>
        <p>
          The way people get rid of unwanted clothes has also changed, with
          items being thrown away rather than donated. Less than half of used
          clothes are collected for reuse or recycling, and only 1% of used
          clothes are recycled into new clothes, since technologies that would
          enable clothes to be recycled into virgin fibres are only now starting
          to emerge. Europeans use nearly 26 kilos of textiles and discard about
          11 kilos of them every year. Used clothes can be exported outside the
          EU, but are mostly (87%) incinerated or landfilled.
